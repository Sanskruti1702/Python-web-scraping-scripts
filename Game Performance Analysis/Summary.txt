Summary:
This project involved building a custom Python-based web scraping solution to collect and analyze game performance data from multiple iGaming operator websites. The goal was to support the launch of a game benchmarking tool by generating structured, clean datasets for competitor and market analysis.

Key Features:
-Scraped structured data (e.g., game names, rankings, positions) from multiple dynamic web sources using BeautifulSoup and Requests
-Implemented data cleaning and formatting logic to prepare raw data for downstream analysis
-Designed scalable scraping workflows and error-handling mechanisms to manage inconsistent site structures and layout changes
