## 1. Game Performance Analysis 
### Summary:
This project involved building a custom Python-based web scraping solution to collect and analyze game performance data from multiple iGaming operator websites. The goal was to support the launch of a game benchmarking tool by generating structured, clean datasets for competitor and market analysis.

### Key Features:
- Scraped structured data (e.g., game names, rankings, positions) from multiple dynamic web sources using Selenium and Requests
- Implemented data cleaning and formatting logic to prepare raw data for downstream analysis
- Designed scalable scraping workflows and error-handling mechanisms to manage inconsistent site structures and layout changes

## 2. Weather Data Scraping
### Summary:
This project involved developing a custom web scraper using Selenium to extract real-time and historical weather data from Canadian meteorological websites. The goal was to support an e-commerce client's demand forecasting and sales analysis for weather-sensitive commodities like pulses, cereals, and millets. The scraper automated navigation across dynamic elements, selected multiple regions and timeframes, and exported clean, structured datasets for business analytics.

### Key Features:
- Collected data such as temperature, humidity, precipitation, and wind speed.
- Standardized the data into CSV format suitable for downstream analysis.
- Enabled the client to correlate weather data with regional sales trends and plan inventory accordingly.
